This week we set up out infrastructure for this problem, including parsing the command line arguments,
reading the data files, normalizing features, and initializing our network. We also implemented forward
propagation logic and most of the backpropagation logic, which we've vectorized. Finally, we started to 
write the code for evaluating the network accuracy on a set of examples.
