This week we finished the implementation of vectorized backpropagation, standardized our continuous inputs,
implemented weight decay, obtained accuracy, precision, and recall measurements, implemented a convergence
check, and made some performance enhancements. The only remaining task before we can start the experiments for
the writeup is the area-under-ROC computation.
