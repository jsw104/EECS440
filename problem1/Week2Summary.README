This week we implemented splitting logic for continious variables. We also
put the split selection logic inside of a recursive function and configured
the recursion/base cases. We added a leaf node object and can now link
the leaf and internal nodes together to make a tree.

Debugging, performance optimization, cross-validation, and gain-ratio are
the major remaining tasks for the third week.
